A demonstration of the apsu-core entity framework.

== Rocks (apsu.demo.rocks) ==

A game where you fly around and shoot rocks until the rocks hit you
and you die.

Note that Rocks uses double precision, which is completely
unnecessary but makes the code simpler. We can get away with it
because the game isn't very taxing.
